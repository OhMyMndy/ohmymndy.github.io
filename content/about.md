With over 11 years of experience as a **Cloud Native Software Engineer**, I have worked across the banking, e-commerce, and professional services industries. 
My strong affinity for **automation**, **testing**, and **observability** enables me to excel in delivering and designing solutions in highly critical environments.

Leveraging expertise in **Linux system administration**, **database administration**, **software development**, and **cloud engineering**, I build future-proof solutions that adhere to industry standards, with automation as a cornerstone. 
Known for creative problem-solving, thought leadership, innovation, and the implementation of DevOps principles, I effectively bridge the gap between developers and operations.

A deep understanding of the entire software development lifecycle allows for seamless collaboration and an optimal **developer experience**.

I am interested in working with the following technologies: **Linux**, **Nix (OS)**, **Talos**, **Kubernetes**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Golang**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, **Prometheus**, **Elasticsearch**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Terraform**, **Google Cloud**, **Backstage**, **Dagger.io**.
